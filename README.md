# CSC-325-NachOS-Projects
My CSC-325 Operating Systems class used a java-based Operating System Simulator called NachOS. The projects of this class include:
- A Doubly-Linked List for later use
- Implementation of basic Interleaving
    - A refinement of the Interleaving to support multiple active threads without concurrency errors
- And the implementation of a Paging System, System Calls, and User Proceses
